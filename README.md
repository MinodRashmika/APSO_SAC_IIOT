# Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) for MEC Task Offloading

This repository contains the implementation and related research for Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) in the context of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The project explores dynamic hyperparameter tuning to optimize resource allocation and task offloading for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments.

---

## Features
- **Adaptive PSO**: Implements the APSO algorithm with dynamic hyperparameter tuning.
- **Task Offloading**: Models MEC scenarios, optimizing latency and cost trade-offs.
- **Integration with RL**: Combines Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with APSO for hybrid optimization.
- **Simulation Framework**: Simulates IIoT environments with varying network speeds, server capacities, and workloads.
